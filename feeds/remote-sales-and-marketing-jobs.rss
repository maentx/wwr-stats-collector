&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should apply if...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are highly reliable with a GSD mindset despite external circumstances. You say what you mean and do what you say. You are consistent and take ownership in situations, large or small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are hyper-organized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are Proactive, see potential problems before they happen, and aren’t afraid to speak up/challenge the status quo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an over-communicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You thrive in a remote work environment. Fully remote work is not for everyone; it requires the ability to quickly pick up online tools, get familiar with our tech stack (G-Drive, Slack, Notion, and a variety of modern reporting tools), and the ability to communicate (and often over-communicate) well in writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You love learning new things. Whether you learn best through reading, listening, doing, or exploring, you’re perpetually curious about the world and work around you and always trying to level up your personal and professional life through self-directed learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Plano, TX USA
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://burada.com"&gt;https://burada.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Burada is growing our team! We are hiring a Marketing Manager to lead our initiatives to grow our business. This role will require you to step out of your comfort zone, grow, and expand. As a leader of a team of contractors and agencies, you will be required to have the experience and creativity to manage all aspects of our marketing campaigns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About Burada&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Burada, we build Social SaaS products that people love to use! Our two flagship SaaS products have had over 150,000 customers. These products help our customers build, manage and automate their online communities. And as a result of our relentless pursuit of customer satisfaction and innovative solution design, our products change our customers' lives each and every day!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About Our Team&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We are a small 100% remote team by design. Our team of 18 is spread out through the US and Eastern Europe, and we need more great people to join us. We are an easy going team, and we also operate with high intensity. We believe in product led growth, and have mastered the art of building amazing SaaS products!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our Founder&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Burge is the Founder and CEO of Burada, which specializes in creating social SaaS products that are enjoyed by over 150,000 customers worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being an entrepreneur at heart, as well as a technical founder, Daniel began his career in the late 90’s building some of the first web applications deployed in Southwest Missouri. One of his early accomplishments was building the first online classified ads systems in partnership with a major ISP. Later he built one of the first online college course registration systems for a local college in Missouri. From there, he has gone on to help many companies create amazing software systems that help automate their business, including consulting with the United Nations on one of their largest digital initiatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In the last five years Daniel has switched his focus completely to online social and community software. One of his SaaS products reached 1000 paid subscribers within just 30 days, and has gone on to serve over 150,000 customers. Daniel’s passion to innovate continues to generate new opportunities as he looks forward to the future and to building more software that changes people's lives.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About The Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This role reports directly to the CEO/CMO.

&lt;li&gt;Develop customer testimonials and case studies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ensure that our website looks great, converts well, and stays on brand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage and ensure that our social media content is coordinated and published. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Conceive and execute any new marketing initiatives required to move your key metric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;About You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You are highly motivated and have a high energy level. You understand how to operate with intensity. You are a self starter, and are biased toward action. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;

      <title>Aha!: Product Marketing Manager</title>
      <region>North America Only</region>
      <category>Sales and Marketing</category>
      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; United States
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.aha.io"&gt;http://www.aha.io&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Aha! is a very different type of high-growth SaaS company. We are self-funded, highly profitable, and 100 percent remote. We provide the world's #1 product development software so teams can build products that customers love. More than 600,000 product builders use our suite of tools which includes &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/roadmaps/overview"&gt;Aha! Roadmaps,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/ideas/overview"&gt;Aha! Ideas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/create/overview"&gt;Aha! Create&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/develop/overview"&gt;Aha! Develop&lt;/a&gt;. And they rely on our training programs via &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/academy"&gt;Aha! Academy&lt;/a&gt; to become product development experts. We are recognized as one of the best fully remote companies to work for, champion the &lt;a href="http://www.bootstrap.company/"&gt;Bootstrap Movement&lt;/a&gt;, and have given over $1M to people in need through &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/company/cares"&gt;Aha! Cares&lt;/a&gt;. Learn more at &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/"&gt;www.aha.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The Aha! marketing team is a highly collaborative group of experts across digital, communications, and product marketing disciplines. We work within North American time zones so we can easily meet live on video and achieve more together.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We drive growth&lt;/strong&gt;: Aha! does not have a sales team — marketing is responsible for increasing awareness and trial sign-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We give big effort&lt;/strong&gt;: We work exceptionally hard and fast, constantly producing content that engages new customers and brings value to existing ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We are curious&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We seek to better understand our market, customers, and products so we can clearly articulate the unique value of what we offer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We have fun&lt;/strong&gt;: We care deeply about our teammates, always making time to celebrate, support, and laugh with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We enjoy&lt;/strong&gt;: We like what we do and we want you to love your job too. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/company/the-responsive-method"&gt;The Responsive Method&lt;/a&gt;, our company &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/company/culture"&gt;values&lt;/a&gt;, and the generous &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/company/careers/benefits"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; we offer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The product marketing group within the broader marketing team is responsible for messaging the unique value of our products and services. We own a broad range of programs — from managing weekly go-to-market launches to producing live product trainings and tools for &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/product/concierge"&gt;concierge support&lt;/a&gt;. We deliver high-quality content, such as educational guides to support our target use cases and best practice articles to help our customers get the most value out of our software.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We do our planning and collaboration in &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/product/overview"&gt;Aha! Roadmaps&lt;/a&gt;. We are power users of our own software, often providing feedback and suggestions for improvements that are shipped to customers too. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You have at least four years of experience in product marketing at a SaaS company. And you are passionate about how sophisticated product development tools can help organizations work in a more productive way. You thrive on being a market, customer, and product expert — so you can communicate the value of your company's offerings with confidence.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You like to work in a fast-paced environment, where launches happen often — not once or twice a year. And you thrive on collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to achieve excellent results. You love honing in on the details and producing exceptional work for effectively marketing products and services.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your work at Aha!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We work on a broad range of marketing initiatives and programs. As Product Marketing Manager, your responsibilities will include:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing weekly go-to-market launches, delivering high-quality messaging and screenshots that communicate the value of new or enhanced functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Producing excellent content for customers — such as guides, live trainings, video scripts, concierge tools, and best practice articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assisting with strategic initiatives and programs to drive new customer adoption and help existing customers get more value out of our software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting the ongoing growth of new products and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working proactively to deepen your understanding of our market, customers, and product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;If the Product Marketing Manager role sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grow with us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Everyone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. And our goal is to help you do just that. We offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing. The specific benefits listed below are reflective of what we offer U.S.-based hires. We also do our best to extend identical benefits to international teammates.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generous salary with annual profit sharing for all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical, dental, and vision plans — for many teammates, we cover 100 percent of the premiums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 200 hours of paid time off a year to spend however you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 to 90 days of paid parental leave and five to 10 days of paid care and bereavement leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to $1,000 annually for third-party education, along with paid time off to immerse yourself in learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aha! contributes a percentage of your total compensation each year towards your retirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.aha.io"&gt;http://www.aha.io&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The Aha! marketing team is a highly collaborative group of experts across digital, content, and product marketing disciplines. We work within North American time zones so we can easily meet live on video and achieve more together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We drive growth:&lt;/strong&gt; Aha! does not have a sales team — marketing is responsible for increasing awareness and trial sign-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We give big effort:&lt;/strong&gt; We work exceptionally hard and fast, constantly producing content that engages new customers and brings value to existing ones. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We are curious: &lt;/strong&gt;We seek to better understand our market, customers, and products so we can clearly articulate the unique value of what we offer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We have fun:&lt;/strong&gt; We care deeply about our teammates, always making time to celebrate, support, and laugh with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt; We like what we do and want you to love your job too. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/company/the-responsive-method"&gt;The Responsive Method&lt;/a&gt;, our company &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/company/culture"&gt;values&lt;/a&gt;, and the generous &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/company/careers/benefits"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; we offer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our programs &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The content group within the broader marketing team is responsible for writing content that powers the growth of our company. We own a broad range of content — blog posts, educational guides, newsletters, social media, and other customer communications. We are deadline-driven and intensely committed to high-quality work.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We care deeply about understanding our customers and market. We aim to create content that is both relevant and refreshing. We embrace direct feedback and revision cycles — all in service to getting the content right. Our work is challenging and meaningful — we are always becoming better writers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We do our planning and collaboration in &lt;a href="https://www.aha.io/product/overview"&gt;Aha! Roadmaps&lt;/a&gt;. We are power users of our own software, often providing feedback and suggestions for improvements that are shipped to customers too. We use Slack and GoToMeeting for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your experience&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You have at least seven years of experience writing about business, software development, innovation, and/or leadership topics. You want to work with people who love words, not jargon. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You welcome feedback. You are resilient, nimble, and always willing to help others improve their content as well. You know that being an exceptional writer demands domain knowledge as well as critical thinking skills. And you are interested in communicating how sophisticated workflow management tools can help organizations be more strategic and productive. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your work at Aha!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We work on a broad range of marketing initiatives and programs. Your responsibilities will include:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering high-quality content within fast-paced production cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning and contributing to the Aha! content style guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peer editing and reviewing content from other writers and the broader team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working proactively to deepen your understanding of our market, customers, and product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing or supporting initiatives that contribute to marketing and company goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.discourse.org"&gt;http://www.discourse.org&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;About Us&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse"&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt; is a global company with a product that is 100% open source. Our team is 75 people and growing. We’re transforming the online community space. Our product powers a substantial segment of successful online communities, with &amp;gt;30,000 Discourse instances globally. We have thousands of paying customers, with a growing number of Fortune 500 companies on our list, alongside many leading players in the fast-growth technology, gaming and blockchain/web3 space&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;About the job&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We’re searching for an enthusiastic Sales Development Representative to join our team and support our growth. Our ideal candidate is a highly motivated deal-maker who loves talking to people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This position is salary + bonus + equity and is not based on commission.&lt;br&gt;There will be a paid trial project after making it through the interview stages. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your responsibilities will include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing inbound sales leads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacting existing customers with upsell opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating new leads via outbound campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordinating pre-sales resources throughout the sales cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consulting with prospects to determine the best solution for their specific needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovering and communicating customer requirements to the engineering and customer success teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re looking for someone who:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has 1-3 years of experience in enterprise software or SAAS sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience developing and leading prospects by understanding and solving specific business issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to “drive a deal” and go beyond relationship management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outstanding leadership, relationship building, and influencing skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A knack for implementing processes, technologies, and solutions for a fast-paced environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills whether it be on the phone, on instant messaging apps, video conferencing, email, or speaking in front of large groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overwhelming level of enthusiasm for building relationships and delivering on promises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;At Discourse, the ability to communicate well in writing is paramount. We use our own software, Discourse, for most communication and most of your interaction with customers and team members will be in writing. In order to live these values, we look for folks who are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detail-oriented, proactive, and organized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to make decisions quickly and communicate effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work well independently and remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kind to their co-workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly driven with an execution focus and a strong belief in our mission to make the internet a better place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;While not a necessity, prior experience with open source software or community management is an advantage&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;About our Pay &amp;amp; Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We believe that high-quality benefits make our team more effective. We’ve been thoughtful about &lt;a href="https://www.discourse.org/team#benefits"&gt;our benefits package &lt;/a&gt;which includes a completely flexible schedule, 5 weeks of vacation per year, funding for a co-working stipend, and much more!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Our Salary Framework is location and experience based and we’re happy to provide a range up front. We also give every employee a stake in the success of the business, regardless of seniority or role. All full-time employees are eligible to receive equity options in the company as part of our equity incentive program.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Lastly, we believe in having a welcoming workplace where people with diverse backgrounds and cultures can create something great together. We encourage you to apply, even if you don’t meet every qualification! Apply by sending a cover letter and resume to &lt;a href="mailto:jobs@discourse.org"&gt;jobs@discourse.org&lt;/a&gt;. Please list your location in order for us to share salary information.&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Soar: Reddit Campaign Manager (Entry level / Part time)</title>
      <region>Anywhere in the World</region>
      <category>Sales and Marketing</category>
      <type>Contract</type>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0081/7456/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&amp;w=50&amp;h=50&amp;dpr=2&amp;fit=fill&amp;auto=compress" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Remote!
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://soar.sh"&gt;https://soar.sh&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Hey there!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We're a community marketing agency and we're looking to partner with a Reddit Marketer to help grow our clients' brands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let's dive in with some background...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We sell growth packages for technology companies in the SEO and virality industries.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our services range from backlinks and written-for-you blog posts to done-for-you Reddit and Quora marketing. We're working on new innovative services all the time, from ProductHunt launch kits to new ways of driving traffic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our clients love us because we're affordable, we guarantee results, and our customer success team is always around to help. Not to mention the services are one-of-a-kind.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here's what you'll be working on in this role... &lt;br&gt;1. You'll dive deep into client websites and figure out what subreddits are a fit for them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. You'll research and find subreddits that are a match for a client. You gotta be creative here. Naturally, you'll have to make sure the posts don't break any subreddit rules.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. You'll draft and propose posts on Reddit that'll help the client achieve their goal. Sometimes it's YouTube views, sometimes it's website visits. The goal when drafting a post is to avoid any kind of self-promotion or spam filters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. You'll work with our Reddit Marketing team to actually launch the campaign. We've got Reddit accounts that we can use for adding comments, upvotes and so forth. We'll give the post the best chance for success.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5. And voila. That's kind of it. We're always working on new services and products so you'll have a lot of flexibility in terms of what you're working on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A great applicant will...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- Have extensive experience marketing across Reddit. With a portfolio of examples of the kind of promotions they've done.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- A strong background in Digital Marketing in general&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- Be a native (or 100% fluent) English speaker&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- Be super organized&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At first, you will start with a training period to get acquainted with our processes and systems. As you get your footing, you will transition into full-time work&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our team culture is fun and fairly laid back. We're always working on new initiatives and projects, which keeps our hands full at all times.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you think you'd be a great fit for this role, please fill out the below application:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;https://form.asana.com/?k=gFQRn6ek7MrJifuwgP3kTw&amp;amp;d=1104710540939302&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Looking forward to meeting, and working with you!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dimitry |&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;CEO @ Soar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Soar: Community Strategist (Client Facing)</title>
      <region>Anywhere in the World</region>
      <category>Sales and Marketing</category>
      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Remote!
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://soar.sh"&gt;https://soar.sh&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Hey there 👋&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My name is Dimitry and I’m the founder of Soar. We’re a marketing agency that helps brands build &amp;amp; grow their communities online. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It’s a new space. Not all companies understand the value of &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt; for their startup or brand, at least not yet. That’s where we come in - to educate and show the power that community has for brands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We work mostly with startups, ecommerce &amp;amp; SaaS companies. Our services are unique and nontraditional&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trending posts on Reddit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quora answers that reference our clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brand mentions &amp;amp; inserts into conversations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subreddit growth &amp;amp; development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;No matter the service, we try to keep the service experience transparent and fair to our customers. It’s a core tenet and a welcome relief for a lot of the people who come to us. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’ve been growing fast during Covid. Our specialization in Reddit combined with the growth of the crypto//creator economy has really pushed us up. Now we need to improve and expand the services we deliver. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That’s where you come in. Our &lt;strong&gt;Community Strategist. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a community strategist, you’re going to own our client accounts and be their go-to point of contact. You’ll be responsible for onboarding, setting up client projects, managing a small team of marketers and ensuring we hit our deadlines, while expanding account value over time. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Expect to be responsible for coming up with community and marketing ideas, coordinating with our service teams to customize services to fit client needs, analyzing and reporting on results and hopping on client calls as their community rep. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a high-impact, high-visibility position that enables you to have a direct impact on the growth and success of your clients. You’ll be working hand-in-hand with leadership and your team to make progress on campaigns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There’s a dynamic mix of marketing management, project management &amp;amp; account management in this role, so be prepared!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;As you settle into this role, you’ll be owning up to 15 clients. Your day to day will depend, but will probably include the following...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with leadership to scope and plan potential campaigns to new clients. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and support your campaign team with existing campaigns. Help review their output and make sure they’re meeting quality standards and deadlines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sync with clients regularly to report on progress and jump in to fix fires as needed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review client analytics &amp;amp; campaign performance and adjust our strategies and tactics accordingly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a brand new role for our team, so you’ll be trailblazing what this role looks like.  Be ready to sit down and help us define SOP’s and set standards as you get more comfortable in your role. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong cross-channel strategic marketing background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurial mindset, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant agency experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent written &amp;amp; spoken communication style &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hours that overlap some with the EST timezone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-motivated and work well independently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable working remotely (we don’t have an office)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have significant overlap with EST hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with blockchain // NFT’s (+10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve been in a leadership position before (+5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve used Hubspot (+5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might NOT want to take this role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are jobs for everyone, but sometimes it's just not a person/role/company fit! Here are reasons this job might not be right for you:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to stay in your comfort zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soar constantly has new challenges, new things going on, and new problems to solve. It's simply not a company where the same thing happens every day. Some people might not like that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to be told exactly what to do. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're looking for more of a straightforward execution role where you can just follow a checklist, this is not it. You'll definitely get support from the team, lots of examples, processes and SOPs, but you are the manager of your projects and new challenges will always arise that you need to lead. Depending on the client and situation, that can mean that you’ll have to be the one treading the path of a new process first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're looking for a regular 9-5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things are not regular at Soar. We move fast, we have exciting new projects and new challenges—it's not something you'll be able to do on autopilot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sound interesting? Apply by filling out the application form below 👇&lt;br&gt;https://form.asana.com/?k=vxCAYhreAhLQ-HY47N5LxQ&amp;amp;d=1104710540939302&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I look forward to reviewing your applications&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Best of luck,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dimitry Apollonsky&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We're also not your standard PR firm. We guarantee our results &amp;amp; never, ever, take the "spray &amp;amp; pray" approach. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Our team is the very best at what they do and we may or may not be having a bit too much fun building this thing together. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Company:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Founded: &lt;/strong&gt;2016 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Employees: &lt;/strong&gt;10 (a small team doing big things) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Growth: &lt;/strong&gt;Last year alone, our revenue doubled &amp;amp; clientele grew by over 30% ● &lt;strong&gt;Location: &lt;/strong&gt;Fully distributed &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brands we've worked with: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/"&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/"&gt;FreshBooks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://us.foursigmatic.com/"&gt;Four Sigmatic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doist.com/"&gt;Doist&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Role: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Primary purpose: &lt;/strong&gt;Conduct outreach for client Podcast Tours &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: Full-time &amp;amp; flexible &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Location: &lt;/strong&gt;Fully remote, live &amp;amp; work anywhere within the U.S. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Other cool perks: &lt;/strong&gt;An additional $1200/year remote work stipend, a generous parental leave policy, team performance bonuses, and an achievable growth trajectory for every role within the company. Oh, and we're awesome. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🍋 The Team &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;We feel it’s crucial to understand the part you play in any team you join, as well as the other roles within it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With that in mind, here’s how our Public Relations team (which we call our Talent Relations team internally, so don’t let our LI profiles confuse you!) is structured:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Head of Public Relations &lt;/strong&gt;- Reports to the CEO. Leads the entire PR team, including each role listed below, and is responsible for all overarching team strategies, processes, metrics, etc. Also the only role in which there will only ever be one person occupying. All other PR team roles will multiply as we grow. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;👏 &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arliekidd/"&gt;Meet Arlie&lt;/a&gt;. Her smile is almost as big as her work ethic. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;💪 What You'll Do &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our Public Relations Associate role exists to aid in providing clients with a successful Podcast Tour via pitching and relationship building. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s a brief breakdown of how you’ll achieve that: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pitching &lt;/strong&gt;- Crafting &amp;amp; sending compelling (&amp;amp; personally tailored - &lt;a href="https://www.lemonpie.fm/host-praise"&gt;we never take the spray &amp;amp; pray approach&lt;/a&gt;) email, video, and social media pitches to podcast hosts to secure guest appearances for our clients on their shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Relationship building &lt;/strong&gt;- Build trust with hosts by ensuring you understand the premise and goal of their show and that any client you pitch them would genuinely add value to their listeners. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅ Requirements &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Qualitative: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other people might call these soft skills, but we don’t believe there’s any such thing. Instead, we call these our People Pillars, because no one gets in without them. They’re not a dusty list of “nice to haves” we keep in our metaphorical basement, only to pull them out when we’re hiring. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;They’re part of the living, breathing organism that is our culture and we don’t risk negatively disrupting it. For anything. Ever. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Not for 20+ years of experience. Not for mind-blowing industry connections. Not for a proven track record of doing every last thing we do as a company with 100% success. Not even for a hand-written referral from Tim Ferriss (we mean it, sorry Tim). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Nothing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That’s why we place an even higher level of importance on our qualitative requirements than our quantitative (which are still very high). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With that, if you can’t honestly see each one of these traits within yourself and are confident they would shine through to us via your written &amp;amp; verbal communication with us, we ask (in our kindest, most gentle voice), that you come back and visit us when you can. 💛 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Kind &lt;/strong&gt;- Speak and act kindly, regardless of the situation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Empathetic &lt;/strong&gt;- Able to authentically put yourself in the shoes of clients and teammates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerable &lt;/strong&gt;- Able to share those “crazy” ideas, respectfully speak up when you disagree with an approach the team or company is taking, and share when you’re going through something personally challenging so we can support you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Funny &lt;/strong&gt;- We’re a company run by young, talented, and fun individuals. If you don’t laugh at a good meme, get sarcasm, and have an easily identified sense of humor (even if it’s different than anyone else’s on the team) we may not be a great fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Personable &lt;/strong&gt;- Clients and team members would enjoy communicating with you. Never, ever, under any circumstances, are you even remotely coarse in your written or verbal communication. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proactive &lt;/strong&gt;- You look ahead to stay ahead of possible challenges &amp;amp; take action before you have to and without prompting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Resourceful &lt;/strong&gt;- Wouldn’t ask anyone something you could Google. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Over-communicative &lt;/strong&gt;- Responsive &amp;amp; engaged. Enjoys speaking to both clients and team members. Provides clients, their team, &amp;amp; the leadership team with status updates as needed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Organized &lt;/strong&gt;- You would honor and improve organizational systems currently in place, keep to-do lists up to date, and manage your time effectively. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Trustworthy &lt;/strong&gt;- We would never have to wonder if you’re working when you say you are, you’d never dream of sharing any inside intel, and you’re always transparent about mistakes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Accountable &lt;/strong&gt;- You own your work for better or worse, meet deadlines, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quantitative &lt;/strong&gt;(Non-negotiables)&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6+ months of pitching experience &lt;/strong&gt;- You’ve run point on conducting outreach (this could be to media outlets, community organizations, etc.) on a regular basis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6+ months of project management experience &lt;/strong&gt;- You’ve been in charge of keeping at least 1 kind of project management platform (Asana, Trello, Basecamp, etc.) up to date on a daily basis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6+ months working with GSuite &lt;/strong&gt;- You’ve regularly used GSuite tools. Specifically, GMail, GCal, &amp;amp; GDrive. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;General PR knowledge &lt;/strong&gt;- You see, understand, &amp;amp; truly believe in the value of PR in the modern marketing sphere. You’d never recommend an ad over good content, write a cheesy CTA, or see adding value to someone’s life or business for free as a waste of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Generally tech-savvy &lt;/strong&gt;- You’re a digital native that’s heard of all systems/tools mentioned throughout this job description. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Impeccable written &amp;amp; verbal communication skills &lt;/strong&gt;- Every role at Lemonpie involves written or verbal communication tailored to our internal brand voice (fun, friendly, informative, &amp;amp; always professionally upbeat) but with each team member's unique stamp on it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Attention to detail &lt;/strong&gt;- We know every job posting on this side of the hemisphere states this as a necessity, but we actually mean it. Not attention to detail like you remember someone’s name. Attention to detail like you notice if someone puts a phrase in italics in an email but missed a letter at the end that’s still in the standard font. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Internally motivated &lt;/strong&gt;- We don’t (and can’t) micromanage, so if you’re someone who needs to be frequently steered in the right direction or doesn’t work well autonomously, we’re just not meant to be. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Independent thinker &lt;/strong&gt;- You see the way something has been done but think independently enough to make it better vs. going with the flow. You come across a unique situation that you haven’t been trained in yet but you can piece together other parts of training, how we handle things as a company from a high-level POV, etc., to come up with a great game plan rather than needing to ask someone how it’s always done. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Intuitive &amp;amp; thorough researcher &lt;/strong&gt;- You’d never miss the fact that a show you’re pitching hasn’t published an episode in a year or doesn’t accept guests, you’re able to easily find the correct host information, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No ego &lt;/strong&gt;- “I don’t need to be right; I need to get it right” aligns with your way of thinking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Coachable &lt;/strong&gt;- Not just from a willingness to learn perspective, but you also take any feedback to heart and apply it right away. We’re able to see our feedback and guidance in your work as you get up to speed &amp;amp; beyond. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Growth mindset &lt;/strong&gt;- You see consistent learning &amp;amp; improving as an extension of any role you serve in. This isn’t fluff. We don’t do so good with “good enough,” truly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You live in the United States. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good to have: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Basic business knowledge &lt;/strong&gt;- You know what the acronyms SaaS, ROI, SEO, SME, B2B, B2C, D2C, KPI, PPC, ARR, CPM etc. are without googling them and you have a good understanding of what businesses expect from the PR vendors they partner with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sales or marketing experience &lt;/strong&gt;- Bonus points if you’ve worked with brands on their sales and/or marketing efforts outside of pitching. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Specific tool experience &lt;/strong&gt;- You’re familiar with Slack, HubSpot, &amp;amp; Notion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Remote work experience &lt;/strong&gt;- You’ve learned a new role primarily asynchronously, have managed your own workflow independently, don’t need a call to navigate hiccups, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You love podcasts &lt;/strong&gt;- It’s kind of our thing. 😉 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚀 Success Indicators &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;How you'll know you're killin' it in this role every step of the way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✨ Benefits &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;Making our people happy makes us happy. Here's how we do it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Live &amp;amp; work where you want &lt;/strong&gt;- We’ve been remote from the start and have a fully distributed team, so you can live anywhere (within the U.S.) and work from anywhere your heart desires. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Flexible schedule &lt;/strong&gt;- As long as you’re available during core business hours and keeping full-time hours (7 am-3 pm, 8 am-4 pm, 10 am-6 pm, etc.), you have the freedom to create a schedule that’s optimal for you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Unlimited PTO &lt;/strong&gt;- Not unlimited so you feel bad taking it, not unlimited but you have to cut through a ton of red tape to use it, and not unlimited to a certain point. Truly unlimited. We strongly believe in working to live, not living to work, and want that to show in all of our employees’ lives. We also know that taking plenty of time away from work is crucial for our mental health, which is why we have a strict 3-week minimum time off each year policy in addition to the ~15 days per year we’re closed. Fun fact: We’ve never denied a time off request in the 5 years we’ve been in business. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Paid parental leave &lt;/strong&gt;- Our maternity &amp;amp; paternity leave is fully paid for up to 18 weeks. We have a mandatory 12 weeks of paid leave for all new parents (biological or adoption) but we encourage you to take as long as you’d like up to 18 weeks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Remote work stipend &lt;/strong&gt;- We add $1,200/yr to all of our salaries to provide our team with an extra $100/month to fuel their remote work-life (coffee when working from a coffee shop, a co-working space, or more loungewear as a reminder that you never have to wear uncomfy pants again). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Real growth opportunity &lt;/strong&gt;- Even though we’re a small company, we’ve intentionally designed our team structure to allow for internal promotion for every role, and the average time someone is with us before getting their first promotion is less than a year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🌠 How To Apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;If everything you've just read has you jumping on a couch Tom Cruise circa 2005 style, consider this your formal invitation to apply! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href="https://makeagif.com/i/iH5zG0"&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can't wait to meet you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You'll be responsible for client retention and upsells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write cold outreach sequences for your clients. This job is heavy on copywriting in English, so we are looking for strong writers only.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 2 years experience in one of the following functions: sales, account management or outbound marketing. You will need to prove results with numbers/KPIs in one of your previous roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with sales and/or marketing copywriting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willing to go the extra mile with a strong work ethic to accelerate your learning; self directed and resourceful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you get energized when talking to people and can maintain that energy all day?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empathetic (innate ability to understand people and business).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process oriented (systemic in your approach)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your friends would say you're organized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your friends would say you're creative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English with strong writing and grammar skills. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Arlington, VA
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://mru.org/"&gt;https://mru.org/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Marginal Revolution University (MRU), a project of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, is on a mission to increase economic literacy and needs your help! This position is remote-friendly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;MRU produces classroom resources (lesson plans, videos, interactive practice, etc.) for high school teachers, university professors, and students. Our goal is to make economics as engaging as possible and utilize the insights from cognitive science to boost learning outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’re hiring a Director of Marketing to join our team. We are looking for a self-directed individual who can bounce between the 10-thousand-foot view of marketing strategy and the 3-inch view of proper execution. One day you’ll be coming up with creative ways to get people interested in economic concepts and the next you’ll be diving into the analytics to see how our latest experiment fared.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You’ll have some great assets to leverage: 300k YouTube subscribers, hundreds of engaging videos, creative econ nerd paraphernalia, a strong search ranking on YouTube and Google, plus a big email list. Most importantly, you’ll join a small, scrappy team who is passionate about communicating economics and have the creative skills to pull off big ideas. Not to mention, you’ll get to work with some of the best economists in the world!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key Responsibilities:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning our overall marketing strategy to reach more teachers (particularly at the high school level)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executing email marketing, SEO, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, ads, mailers, and conference strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing key partnerships to reach high school and university educators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing, implementing, and analyzing marketing experiments; running our monthly analytics meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protecting and improving the MRU brand; giving final sign-off on all marketing copy, creative, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building an effective marketing team (leveraging internal resources, contractors, and recruiting future employees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Qualifications:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A passion for bringing education to millions of students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity and passion for life-long learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 5 years of proven marketing experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong organizational skills and attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An experimental and analytical mindset; comfortable launching and analyzing online experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with funnel-based analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery of digital marketing tactics (email marketing, social media, ads, SEO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track-record of success in building audiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nice to have:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience marketing to high school teachers and administrators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest and familiarity with economics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with event marketing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benefits (to name a few…):&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health and dental insurance coverage (which includes paying 100% of individual health and dental insurance premium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flexible, professional, open office environment that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlimited paid time off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term disability, life insurance, 403(b) retirement savings program, and so much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 free credit hours per semester at George Mason University!&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Off The Record: Head of Growth Marketing (First Marketing Hire) @ Legal Marketplace Startup</title>
      <region>Anywhere in the World</region>
      <category>Sales and Marketing</category>
      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Seattle, WA
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://offtherecord.com/"&gt;https://offtherecord.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We are a 25-person strong, fully remote startup. The culture we foster is important to us. You can count on us to listen, to be honest, and to try our best to do what’s right, every day. At OTR, we each have a responsibility to ensure every team member has an equal opportunity to succeed, to be heard, to exchange ideas openly, to build lasting relationships, and to do the work of their life. Best of all, you will be able to feel deep pride in the work you do, because your contribution helps us make the world better. And for that, you’ll be loved by us, our customers, and the world in which we live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Opportunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We have product-market fit. Our service is used by thousands daily. And we're profitable. But our legal services marketplace is just getting started. We haven't even penetrated 1% of available market share. This is where you come in. You'll help us turn a product that users love into a household name. Over 100,000 drivers are pulled over and ticketed every day. How do you put our app into each of their hands?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While we generate tens of millions in revenue, we've never had a marketing team, or a marketing hire. We've still managed to grow triple digits year over year. We're now looking for that elusive, talented, almost-mythical marketing mind to join the team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who You Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You are an experienced marketer, with scars and triumphs under your belt. You are as comfortable strategizing as you are executing. You're comfortable with deadends and the all too common lack of data, but you don't get stuck, you persevere. You know when to double down and when to call it quits. You're always tackling multiple efforts on multiple fronts. You'd tackle even more, but there are only so many hours in the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ideally, you've successfully built up products at other startups. Marketplace experience? Even better. You understand that B2C is completely different from B2B, and the former excites you more. You have experience building a team around you, as marketing efforts scale up. And others can speak of your marketing prowess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You're comfortable thinking big picture. You have a vision for what needs to be accomplished, and how, but you haven't forgotten how to roll up your sleeves and getting in the weeds doesn't intimidate you. Actually, you enjoy it - you feel like you can do most tasks better anyways. You are, after all, an operator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can tackle everything from SEM and SMM to PR and content strategies. You can not only formulate a strategy to reach out to influencers, but also get them onboard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It goes without saying that you are an excellent communicator, both written and verbal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last but not least, you adopt &lt;em&gt;lean&lt;/em&gt; principles and you are data driven. How will you measure each channel and experiment? What is and isn't scalable or repeatable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As OTR's first marketing hire, you'll come in and take charge. You'll own your KPIs while dealing with the ambiguity. We don’t know what we don’t know, but we're eager to experiment and learn. We're looking for someone who will eventually grow into a CMO role and build our marketing org.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If this sounds like your next challenge, introduce yourself. Tell us your favorite marketing content (i.e. podcasts, books, etc.) and how you stay sharp in this ever changing role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;img src="https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0064/4709/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&amp;w=50&amp;h=50&amp;dpr=2&amp;fit=fill&amp;auto=compress" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Miami, FL
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.convertflow.com"&gt;https://www.convertflow.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Independent ecommerce brands need your help. Here's your chance to join the independent ecommerce movement and impact the future of the industry.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;At ConvertFlow, we're helping brands own their growth and stay independent of Big Tech platforms that seek to control how consumers shop and who they shop with.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For independent ecommerce brands, the Big Tech platforms are increasingly feeling like "the empire" that's oppressing them with margin-crushing platform fees and ever-increasing ad costs—limiting access to new customers and the brand's existing audience.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We're "arming the rebels" by empowering independent brands with the tools they need to deliver personalized shopping experiences across the channels they own—such as their own website, email, and SMS audience. This way, they can win over more customers, increase loyalty, and create a thriving business while being in control of their own future.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;To do this, we've built ConvertFlow, the all-in-one funnel builder for ecommerce. ConvertFlow empowers brands to create, test, and personalize shopping experiences, without coding or relying on developers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Since we started ConvertFlow, we've helped over 30,000 brands drive more revenue and own their growth. We've seen our customers start small and scale big. Today, ConvertFlow empowers businesses of all sizes—from entrepreneurs with big visions to iconic brands like Porsche, Audi, Volkswagen, and Nectar Sleep.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;About the role&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’re looking for a Content Marketer to help take our growing blog and written content to the next level. You will work closely with our Marketing Manager on strategy and topic ideation, but maintain plenty of autonomy when it comes to execution.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You’ll be expected to:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideate on relevant topics and perform SEO keyword research&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're a small, bootstrapped analytics company with a remote team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll be the first sales hire to join the team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should have 3-4 years experience in B2B Sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your goal is to systematize, improve, and scale our Sales processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll start managing the inbound pipeline and reactivating old leads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then add outbound prospecting to develop the pipeline further&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll also do post-sale account management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As well as 1:1 demos, group demos, and qualification calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be in European / US East Coast timezones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a full-time, remote role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link to apply below!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;a href="https://affilimate.com/jobs/software-developer/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://affilimate.com"&gt;Affilimate&lt;/a&gt; is an analytics platform that helps media companies, marketers, and creators grow their website's affiliate revenue by understanding exactly where their revenue is coming from.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Our platform tracks millions of visitors per day, and millions in revenue per month, for our customers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We're looking to make our &lt;strong&gt;first Sales hire&lt;/strong&gt;, who will help us systematize our Sales pipeline and processes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We've been around for over 2 years. We have a predictable inbound sales pipeline driven by content and word-of-mouth, plus a demo that converts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Our goal is to move upmarket and start bringing on bigger accounts with higher ACVs, who will get immense value from our platform.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We're looking for someone who knows how to be scrappy, get things done, and brings early stage SaaS sales experience to the table.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In return, you'll work closely with the founders and get exposure across the business, as well as the potential for equity based on performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What you'll do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with our Support and Onboarding teams to identify high value inbound leads, get them on a demo, nurture them through the trial, reach the point of value, and close them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualify and coordinate inbound demo requests, and ultimately do demos for prospects yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop cold email campaigns and reactivate cold leads we've previously demo'd to, or came in through our self-serve signup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a consultative approach to selling, and understand the needs and challenges of prospective customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspire prospects regarding the value and potential of our platform, and adapt your pitch to their pain points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage your accounts post-sale, to make sure they're getting value and seeing success with the platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help shape our Sales strategy and processes, to make them scalable, predictable, and repeatable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your main KPI is added MRR, and we'll expect you to generate an additional $3-5K MRR in the first few months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Our founding team is based in Berlin, Germany.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While is a remote role, you absolutely need to be located in either European or Eastern US timezones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Reliable internet and a distraction-free place to take calls is a must.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pay and Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Since we're a remote company, the exact benefits will vary based on where you live. If you need something to be happy and successful that's not listed here, let us know and we'll do our best to accommodate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work remotely and enjoy flexible hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 week holiday allowance + public holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36,000 - 48,000 EUR base + commissions on new sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work closely with the founding team at an early stage SaaS company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Equity is also on the table for the right candidate, based on performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Closing date: Friday 4 November, 2022&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;SEO content is a key part of our sales strategy. Earlier this year we recruited a Head of Content and a Senior Content Marketer, who are responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of Barn2's content strategy. Much of our content is currently written by freelancer copywriters, and we are looking for a talented content writer with WordPress experience to become a permanent member of our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You will be responsible for writing new articles and tutorials based on the outlines and SEO research which other members of the marketing team will provide. You will also refresh and improve existing content in order to increase the search rankings and conversions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everything you do will be focussed on sales and conversions. You will follow a data-driven content creation cycle, in which you are asked to produce new content in response to data and evidence, which is then evaluated in order to maximize its impact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a permanent, full-time position working remotely from your own location - although we can consider part-time hours if needed. Depending on your skills and experience, we are offering a salary range of &lt;strong&gt;$32,000 - $40,000 USD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things you’ll be doing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Depending on your skills and experience, you will be doing some or all of the following activities:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a high volume of high quality blog posts, articles and tutorials to meet the objectives on Barn2’s content calendar and business objectives. These will be based on the outlines provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizing your writing for SEO according to the keywords in the article outline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatting your work to meet Barn2’s content guidelines in terms of house style and formatting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating and rewriting existing content - for example, to focus on a different keyword, increase the word count, or to reflect recent changes in a plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing and editing documentation in the plugin knowledge base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Producing guest posts for other WordPress-related companies and blogs, based on the outline and guidelines provided by other members of the marketing team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with customers to create plugin case studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating well-optimized supporting images to illustrate content, including plugin screenshots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyzing the impact of your work and making recommendations for further improvements and/or new content opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will need&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hard skills:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Proven experience of writing articles or tutorials about WordPress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience of writing high quality articles and tutorials for publication online.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ability to create professional screenshots to illustrate your articles, including basic image editing such as cropping and sizing images, and optimizing image size for fast load times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Soft skills:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

      <region>Anywhere in the World</region>

      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0081/8547/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&amp;w=50&amp;h=50&amp;dpr=2&amp;fit=fill&amp;auto=compress" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; UK
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://barn2.com"&gt;https://barn2.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Closing date: Friday 4 November, 2022&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Content is a key part of our sales strategy. While we have a YouTube channel with over 3,000 subscribers, our video strategy is not as sophisticated as our other marketing channels and is an area with huge potential. We wish to hire an enthusiastic, fun and talented video creator with WordPress experience to take our videos to the next level. If this sounds like you then we’d love to hear from you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You’ll be responsible for creating YouTube videos for Barn2. The videos will be a mix of ‘How to’ tutorials about our plugins, general videos about WordPress and WooCommerce, and announcements about events such as sales and webinars. They will consist of you being on camera, images, and screencasts with voiceover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You’ll need experience of both hands-on production and editing, taking care of all stages of the video production process. Depending on your skills and experience, you may either implement a video strategy and SEO goals provided by our Head of Content, or you may take the lead on research and strategy yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The role will be flexible and varied, working across multiple video platforms. You’ll need to be motivated to produce high quality content at a high volume with minimal supervision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everything you do will be focussed on sales and conversions. You will follow a data-driven video creation cycle, in which you seek evidence to inform planning; implement the videos; and then seek further data to evaluate the impact and make ongoing improvements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a permanent, full-time position working remotely from your own location - although we can consider part-time hours if needed. Depending on your skills and experience, we are offering a flexible salary range of &lt;strong&gt;$35,000 - $50,000 USD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things you’ll be doing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Depending on your skills and experience, you will be doing some or all of the following activities:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a video content calendar to deliver Barn2’s video strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Producing and editing engaging educational, general, and brand video content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with customers to obtain video testimonials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating supporting images to illustrate videos, such as opening and closing slides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with Barn2’s designer to create featured images for videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional - Producing other types of video such as video tutorials and animated gifs showcasing our plugins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional - SEO keyword research and analytics to identify ideas for new videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional - Analysing the impact of existing videos and looking for new opportunities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional - Creating your own featured images for the videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional - Networking with other companies to grow our presence across other YouTube channels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional - Managing Barn2’s paid YouTube ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hard skills:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic experience of working with the WordPress CMS - for example, creating a WordPress site, managing content, or installing plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience of producing and editing high quality videos for publication online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience creating screencasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to create professional images to illustrate your videos, including basic image editing such as cropping and sizing images, and opening and closing slides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with YouTube trends and conventions, with the ability to utilize these techniques to increase subscribers, views, and overall engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Soft skills:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect spoken English with a clear accent. If English is not your first language then your speech must be completely fluent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good on-camera and narration skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An engaging, enthusiastic personality that will capture the viewer’s interest and make them excited about our products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to create videos that drive outcomes, translating software features into compelling videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to describe technical software in a clear and accessible way.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Excellent attention to detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relaxed and confident in front of the camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to have&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced-level WordPress experience, plus WooCommerce. (Coding experience is not required.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience in creating and implementing video strategy, with a strong instinct for what makes video content succeed online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience of creating videos about WordPress themes and plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience of using analytics and other tools to evaluate the impact of videos and identify new opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to create more advanced graphics and animated gifs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience of managing and evaluating YouTube ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking skills, with the ability to perform effective outreach and link building work, nurturing relationships with influential Vloggers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Clarity is a globally distributed organization with headquarters in Berkeley, CA.  We are empowering the world to reduce air pollution. We do that by making it possible to measure and understand air pollution issues and then take action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today, when cities or industrial facilities want to measure air quality, they have to spend a lot of money on expensive equipment, installation, and maintenance - to get the accurate data needed to attack air quality problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Clarity has a better approach. With many low-cost devices spread over a geographic area, our customers can perform hyper-local monitoring where information is relayed into the cloud and then flows into web-based tooling to drive analysis and decisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We envision a world where novel sensing technology, IoT, and cloud computing simplify air quality measurement, enabling cities and industrial facilities to scale up the number of monitoring sites and take data-driven action. Our Sensing-as-a-Service solution for air quality is currently deployed in over 60 countries and is changing how municipalities and industrial facilities approach air quality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We have software engineers around the world and a hardware team centered in Berkeley. A customer success team, also geographically distributed, supports our customers now spanning 6 continents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Full-time, exempt position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some travel expected, less than 20% to include client visits, tradeshows, and company offsite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compensation is commensurate with experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reports to the Director of Sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location: This is a fully remote, work-from-home position. Clarity Movement has no central office but staff collaborates extensively via video call meetings. The candidates must furnish their own quiet office space for meetings. Clarity Movement provides a computer and other basic office equipment to ensure you are set up for being able to work comfortably, along with additional funds for the costs of working from home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You’re innately curious to learn ‘why’ and ‘how’ and are a self-starter who likes to get their hands on new problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have the sophistication to navigate a B2B sales process combined with the urgency required to hit weekly or monthly targets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have unquestioned ethics and clarity around doing the right thing for our customers, your co-workers, and the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are highly reliable with a GSD mindset despite external circumstances. You say what you mean and do what you say. You are consistent and take ownership in situations, large or small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are Proactive, see potential problems before they happen, and aren’t afraid to speak up/challenge the status quo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You thrive in a remote work environment. Fully remote work is not for everyone; it requires the ability to quickly pick up online tools, gets familiar with our tech stack (G-Drive, Slack, Notion, and a variety of modern reporting tools), and the ability to communicate (and often over-communicate) well in writing.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and execute on outbound email sequence campaigns and cold calling strategies to qualify potential customers as a match for our SaaS technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualify outbound opportunities and develop a strong demo pipeline via phone and email communications&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Become an expert in enterprise social media &amp;amp; content creation, learn how to “speak the language” of our core customers, identify their pain points, and make compelling &amp;amp; relevant outreach to get them interested in learning more&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>SimpleTexting: Senior Demand Generation Manager</title>
      <region>Anywhere in the World</region>
      <category>Sales and Marketing</category>
      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0081/7033/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&amp;w=50&amp;h=50&amp;dpr=2&amp;fit=fill&amp;auto=compress" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Miami Beach, FL 
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://simpletexting.com"&gt;https://simpletexting.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;SimpleTexting is looking for a talented Senior Demand Generation Manager to join our growing marketing team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You’ll work directly with our Head of Marketing to build and execute strategies that drive brand awareness and customer acquisition. You’ll have two talented direct reports, real budget ownership, cross-team collaboration with an amazing content team, and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Do you want to build the anti-MQL playbook?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At SimpleTexting, we've built a finely-tuned content marketing machine that's driven impressive growth over the past few years. Our strong presence in the SERPs is combined with solid word-of-mouth and high NPS, all buoyed by a category that is set to continue growing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This puts us in a privileged position to think about Demand Generation differently than most B2B companies. We don’t do expensive trade shows, flood our sales team with unqualified webinar leads, and say things like “if it’s not trackable, it shouldn’t be done.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Instead in the last six months we’ve invested in organic &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@simpletexting?lang=en"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, run targeted Podcast ads, used paid social channels to distribute content, and practiced first-principles thinking when it comes to growth. In other words, for us Demand Gen ≠ spray-and-pray Lead Gen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you think you could thrive in an environment like this, then let’s get to the details 👇&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll develop and improve our marketing strategy to better generate and capture demand based on customer insights and data from existing channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll manage, lead, and coach our Performance Marketing Manager and Demand Generation Specialist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll start new marketing campaigns from the ground up, and bring ideas from a raw concept to a finished campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll be responsible for running experiments across our paid and owned marketing channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll work with our Performance Marketing Manager to own the allocation of our paid media budget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll analyze, influence and optimize our website, landing pages, blogs and external content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What we’re looking for&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have at least 2+ years of experience in a Senior Demand Generation or Growth Marketing role for a B2B SaaS company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have 1+ years of experience managing a team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience owning quantifiable metrics and can speak to past success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a background in performance marketing and feel comfortable navigating different ad platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know how to identify new channels that work and then improve existing ones through systematic experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re no stranger to leading people, strategy, and projects, but also aren’t afraid to roll up your sleeves and make things happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience working as part of a remote team utilizing chat (Slack) and video calls on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What’s in it for you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’re pioneers in remote working. Since our beginnings in 2010, our team has been 100% remote, spread across different corners of the world. The SimpleTexting culture is built upon trust and initiative, and all of our employees have it in bucket loads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Remote working isn’t for everyone, so if you thrive in a busy office with water cooler and coffee chats, we might not be the right fit for you. We're a great fit if you're looking for the opportunity to own your role and build your career in an exciting, fast-growing industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;SimpleTexting is proudly part of Sinch, a leading global Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS) provider, offering messaging, voice and video communication solutions to a large global customer base.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our values of &lt;strong&gt;Dream big, Win together, Keep it simple and Make it happen&lt;/strong&gt; are what make us successful on our journey to be the global leader in customer engagement for SMBs, so people who feel a connection to these values and like the pace of a fast-growing global company will easily fit into our team. We are committed to building a company that empowers individuals from a diverse set of backgrounds to be their authentic self and bring their values into their work. We know that the more diverse and inclusive we are, the better our success will be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you’re looking for the next opportunity in your career and are excited to help build our business in the United States, please apply now!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Please do not apply for this role if you are not physically located in the Americas (UTC-6 to UTC-5 / EST or CST specifically)&lt;/strong&gt;. While this is a remote position, we can not consider candidates that are not based in these regions. You can find a detailed explanation in our&lt;a href="https://hotjar.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/REC/pages/269942975/Recruitment+FAQs#Because-it%E2%80%99s-a-remote-job%2C-why-does-it-matter-what-time-zone-or-region-I%E2%80%99m-in%3F"&gt; Recruitment FAQs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;At Hotjar, we’re creating Product Experience Insights software for digital product teams. We help show how users behave and what they feel strongly about, so product teams can deliver real value, fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Reporting to the Sales Lead, we’re looking for creative, curious, and driven sales professionals to join our team and help more SMBs and mid-market businesses build better experiences for their users while growing their business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you have experience selling to inbound prospects and you enjoy working in a hyper-growth environment, this is a rare opportunity to join an early-stage, customer-centered, and 100% distributed team. You will manage a pipeline of inbound leads, whether that’s reactively offering your time and expertise or reaching out to prospects to guide them through their purchasing process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage a pipeline of opportunities at different stages in the sales funnel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with technical members of the Hotjar team to ensure consistency, clarity, and accuracy in all recommendations provided to current and prospective customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate prospective customer needs to product managers and product teams to close the feedback loop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help refine the self-service experience for leads that fall outside of the sales touch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2+ years of sales experience, ideally SaaS and quota-carrying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are technically minded. You can develop a deep knowledge of how Hotjar works, allowing you to speak clearly to customers and communicate their needs to our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are experienced with taking sales calls, diligently following up, and closing deals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <region>Anywhere in the World</region>
      <category>Sales and Marketing</category>
      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0081/2181/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&amp;w=50&amp;h=50&amp;dpr=2&amp;fit=fill&amp;auto=compress" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Miami Beach, FL 
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://simpletexting.com"&gt;https://simpletexting.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;We’re SimpleTexting, an SMS marketing and business texting platform connecting businesses across North America to their customers. We’re all about building connections and making life as easy as possible for our customers when it comes to texting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We believe in what we do (and so do our customers) which is why we need an SEO specialist to join our marketing team and help spread the word. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We already have a catalog of content, but the SMS industry is competitive as ever and we want to stand out. If you have experience writing engaging SEO and creating social content, we’d love to hear from you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why us?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’re pioneers in remote working. Since 2015 our team has been 100% remote, spread across different corners of the world. The SimpleTexting culture is built upon trust and initiative, and all of our employees have it in bucket loads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here’s why we think this is a great opportunity:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You won’t be stuck marketing a dud product:&lt;/strong&gt; We have a high NPS score, strong word-of-mouth, and a host of excellent reviews on third-party sites like Capterra and G2 Crowd that you should check out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Messaging is a high-growth market&lt;/strong&gt;: In 2022, 70% of all consumers have opted in to receive texts from businesses, and this is only set to grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You’ll get mentorship and growth opportunities:&lt;/strong&gt; Our team has deep experience in content marketing and a drive for continuous improvement. You’ll have the opportunity to grow your skills in copywriting and SEO while exploring other aspects of marketing that interest you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who are you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have at least 2-3 years of hands-on copywriting and content optimization experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;We need someone who writes engaging, polished articles and landing pages and can optimize content for our target keywords. You’re not afraid to dive deep into topic research and interview industry experts to create content that people actually want to read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You’re well versed in on-page SEO.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;SEO is a major part of our marketing mix, so we need someone who knows how to research topics and keywords and optimize pages for rankings. You write like a human, but you know what elements a page needs to drive organic traffic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re curious.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’re big on growth, which means you should both want to learn and have the initiative to know when a new skill or tool is needed. You need to keep up with content marketing best practices, and that requires a desire to build your knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll really impress us if…&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have B2B content marketing experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a variety of strong writing samples, from blog posts and landing pages to social posts and even video scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know how to use tools like SEMrush and Google Analytics to analyze content performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience with video content — behind the scenes, on camera, or both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What’s in it for you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’re pioneers in remote working. Since our beginnings in 2010, our team has been 100% remote, spread across different corners of the world. The SimpleTexting culture is built upon trust and initiative, and all of our employees have it in bucket loads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our benefits package depends on your location. However, all of our employees receive generous PTO, a competitive salary and participation in our employee referral program. U.S. applicants also receive healthcare and 401k. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE COMPANY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our mission is to build the Covariant Brain, a universal AI to give robots the ability to see, reason and act on the world around them. Bringing AI from research in the lab to the infinite variability and constant change of our customer’s real-world operations requires new ideas, approaches and techniques.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Success in the real world requires a team that represents that world: diversity of backgrounds, points of view, and experiences. Our common denominator: ambitious expectations, love of learning, empathy for those around us, and a team-first mindset.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the appeal of this role at our stage is that no two weeks will look precisely the same. However, in any given week you’d be…  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://conversion-rate-experts.com/"&gt;https://conversion-rate-experts.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Join our remote-working, highly paid team—and get to improve the world’s best websites&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;aspire to create the world’s best websites&lt;/strong&gt; and influence the future of the web?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seek to apply your skills and know-how to &lt;strong&gt;projects that reward exceptional performance?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;want to collaborate with a team that challenges, encourages, and supports you to do the &lt;strong&gt;best work of your life?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yearn for &lt;strong&gt;freedom, autonomy, mastery, and work-life balance&lt;/strong&gt;—and never have to return to an office?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Conversion Rate Experts (CRE) might be the place for you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The top five reasons our team members joined us (according to them)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Work from anywhere in the world you choose.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for the very best people, so we won’t be restricted by your location. We won’t expect you to visit clients either, so you can spend the whole day doing productive work—and the whole evening with your loved ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Collaborate with prestigious clients.&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine what it will feel like to lead projects for companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Dropbox.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;We pay considerably more than most other agencies,&lt;/strong&gt; because we know that one brilliant mind is worth a hundred mediocre ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Learn to be the best in the world.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll reveal every secret we’ve ever discovered about growing web businesses. You get to be entrepreneurial but without the risk. You’ll receive regular mentoring and training designed to optimize your performance, time, and income. You’ll also have the freedom to use the latest technology, as well as the budget to work with the best vendors in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Extremely collaborative culture.&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty much every newcomer expresses surprise at how helpful and sharing our team is. If you’d like to discover more about what it’s like to work with us, &lt;a href="https://conversion-rate-experts.com/culture/"&gt;here’s an article about our culture&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most revealing article we’ve ever published, and is well worth a read if you’re considering joining our team.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Join our team of experts, designers, copywriters, and entrepreneurs—who are responsible for delivering amazing (and measurable) results for our clients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’re looking for web marketers with a proven track record of growing online businesses.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You’ll provide our clients with the following:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and ideas to measurably grow their businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production-ready content (that’s both user-friendly and persuasive).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unbiased technology recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly professional project management and leadership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We understand that you may already have clients or projects of your own, and that’s fine. Please mention this in your application. Some of our team members have the freedom of being self-employed—although this does mean you’ll manage your own taxes and home-office expenses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interested, but not sure if you’re qualified?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you aren’t sure whether you’re suitable, please apply anyway. We have loads of experience recognizing talent and, at the very least, the application process will reveal the skills we believe are valuable. More details are available at &lt;a href="https://conversion-rate-experts.com/careers/"&gt;conversion-rate-experts.com/careers/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone is welcome here. You can be yourself, and feel you belong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are striving to make CRE an environment where everyone can shine and thrive. We do not discriminate. We uphold and celebrate our differences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In many respects our team is diverse: Our team members are in seven countries, speak five languages, and have a fantastic array of backgrounds, experiences, and personal challenges. Still, we are committed to becoming much better. Please know that you’re welcome, and can be yourself here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, diversity is key to our company’s success. Our clients—and their customers—differ in their languages, pronouns, racial identities, ages, passions, beliefs, neurodiversities, accessibility requirements, family circumstances, and social needs. Without diversity, inclusivity, and empathy, we would not be able to gain the understanding we need to grow our clients’ businesses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Pace and schedule are also flexible, though our ideal candidates will have the time to write at least one guide per month (~10-15 hours per week). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a company, we value diversity and encourage people of all backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, to apply. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you’re interested, please send a resume as well as two writing samples to writing@litcharts.com.

      <title>Tawkify: Professional Matchmaker</title>
      <region>USA Only</region>
      <category>Sales and Marketing</category>
      <type>Contract</type>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0001/7725/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&amp;w=50&amp;h=50&amp;dpr=2&amp;fit=fill&amp;auto=compress" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; San Francisco / New York
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://tawkify.com/w/joinourteam"&gt;https://tawkify.com/w/joinourteam&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We come together with one common thread: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A desire to create a positive impact in our clients’ love lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tawkify is not only known for the clients we match, but the people behind them. Our team of world-class matchmakers come from diverse backgrounds and are often masters of their game. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’ve found the most successful matchmakers possess the following qualities: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Trust &amp;amp; Accountability&lt;/strong&gt;: deep commitment to building strong, meaningful relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Professional &amp;amp; Organized: &lt;/strong&gt;meticulous attention to detail; rarely drops the ball. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Warmth &amp;amp; Dedication&lt;/strong&gt;: positive, relatable, and someone to count on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tactical &amp;amp; Strategic&lt;/strong&gt;: seamlessly execute small tasks; keeping big picture in perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Creative &amp;amp; Resourceful&lt;/strong&gt;: unafraid to lean in to the unknown and adapt to challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Perks:&lt;/strong&gt; We are committed to providing clients and curating a roster that best suits each Matchmaker’s goal. Our matchmakers are exclusively invited to 1-on-1 coaching, mentorship, and weekly workshop opportunities that are designed to foster their own professional growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, we’re real… and we value transparency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;So, here’s the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.luminpdf.com/viewer/5e41c36cb1293e001146eb21"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trade Secrets of a Tawkify Matchmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a Matchmaker, you help create a positive impact on the love lives of Tawkify members by leveraging your expertise in interpersonal relationships, recruiting, and coaching; ensuring high quality date experiences, member satisfaction, and accountability on many levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’ve found the most successful matchmakers excel in the following competencies:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; handle all relationships judiciously and empathetically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Project Management: &lt;/strong&gt;prioritize all members into your schedule, especially clients. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; proactive; clearly (re)sets expectations at scale; honors commitment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Networking:&lt;/strong&gt;  Finding potential matches online and offline via multi-channel outreach. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; Familiarity with video conferencing platforms (Zoom), cloud-based technologies (Google Suite, Calendly) and project-management tools (like Trello). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Get personal. Detach from outcomes. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promote love as an experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You're responsible for guiding clients through their matchmaking experience and connecting them to the magic of blind dating with quality matches and curated dates in real life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At Tawkify, we empower our clients to enjoy the experience, rather than focus on the outcome. Same goes for our Matchmakers.
