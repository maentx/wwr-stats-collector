&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For our new course platform, we are hiring customer service representatives to scale our support team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our platform is new and you will be the first full time customer service representative of the whole company, trained directly by the founder. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our company is starting to get a lot of support requests already, so this is a great time to join the company straight from the beginning, and make a long career with us. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now, we have a limited number of requests per day, so you would be busy learning the system and getting familiar with the product.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your responsibilities will be:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- learn the software product and start answering support questions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- help write and maintain the help center documentation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- test the product and report any issues you find, as a way to get familiar with it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main skills that you need for this task are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- fluent, native-like English is essential, because you will be writing to customers, and writing documentation in English&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- familiarity with software products, web hosting products, and preferably online course platforms would be ideal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- some basic understanding of how DNS works would be a huge plus, especially familiarity with setting up the DNS for a website using CNAME and CAA DNS records.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The job perks and conditions are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- 300 USD per month, negotiable&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- full time job as a freelancer, you can't take this as a part-time&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- you will be paid either directly via wire transfer if you have a freelancer company, or via Upwork Direct contracts&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- work from home, fully remote&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- work in your own timezone, you don't need to adapt to our timezone (European CET)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- 8h a day, flexible schedule&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Your schedule is flexible, but you need to work most of your hours in the morning and afternoon of your timezone&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- You need to be available for work from the 22nd of December till the first week of January, and from mid-July to mid-August&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- other than that, you can take 20 days of leave per year &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To apply to this job, send me an email to admin@onlinecoursehost.com with your CV. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But please don't just send the CV over, highlight on the message any experience that you have with course platforms, hosting services, software services, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is way more important to me than previous customer support experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I tend to get a lot of replies, so please send the passphrase "cat", just to show you read this message and it's not an automated reply, I hope you don't mind this little trick :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the body of your email, tell me in your own words and in detail what our company and product is about. What does the software do, what is the target audience, who are the competitors in this space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't copy paste text from the website, I need you to tell me that in your own words. The goal is to see if you understand what the product is, and to see your English level as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tell me specifically if you understand DNS. What is it and what is your experience with it, if any.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also tell me your country and timezone where you will be working from. Tell also a bit about yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please write also any questions you might have, I'm looking forward to hearing from you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kind Regards,&lt;br&gt;Vasco Cavalheiro&lt;br&gt;Founder&lt;br&gt;OnlineCourseHost.com &lt;/div&gt;

      <title>OnTheGoSystems: Experienced WP Technical Supporters</title>
      <region>Europe Only</region>
      <category>Customer Support</category>
      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0076/2990/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&amp;w=50&amp;h=50&amp;dpr=2&amp;fit=fill&amp;auto=compress" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; 100% remote
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://onthegosystems.com"&gt;https://onthegosystems.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Our goal in support is to help clients succeed. We are hiring support experts for &lt;a href="https://wpml.org/"&gt;WPML&lt;/a&gt; team. You’ll troubleshoot problems and help clients use our products. You’ll be working closely with other supporters, with the development team, and with the documentation team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Being an OnTheGoSystems supporter is about helping people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We work hard and have fun together. We are offering work from home with a very strong team of supporters and developers. Our support team is divided into smaller teams within similar time zones, where supporters can consult and help each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You will be replying to questions from clients, debugging issues, looking at configurations and code lines, talking to other team members and escalating issues or features to our development teams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You will, of course, need to &lt;strong&gt;know WordPress inside out&lt;/strong&gt; including templates, taxonomy, custom post types, and more, and it would be a nice plus if you have some experience with our products (WPML &amp;amp; Toolset).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It’s important to be a good team player, an excellent communicator, to be creative, straightforward and honest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You do need a reliable strong internet connection (we have calls daily) and self-discipline, especially when you are almost done but there’s a client reporting an issue that needs debugging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We are looking for people who know what GIT, WP Loop, PhpStorm, Taxonomy and .MO files are, and if they don’t are very happy to learn! We are constantly teaching ourselves new technologies and workflows and we have an intensive training program both for newbies and experienced supporters. Above all, we are looking for people who just &lt;strong&gt;love helping others and get satisfaction from resolving problems&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;– At least 2 years of proven experience in a &lt;strong&gt;Technical&lt;/strong&gt; Customer support role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;– Experience building websites using WordPress&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;– Excellent English skills (both written and spoken)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;– Outstanding problem-solving skills&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;– Being able to work one day over the weekend (not a must-have but a huge advantage)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we offer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;100% remote position. &lt;/strong&gt;Candidates must be self-motivated, focused, and organized to succeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be part of a team of smart, self-driven individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a full-time and steady position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet and collaborate with team members across the globe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A generous home-office setup budget to create or improve your workspace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A yearly scholarship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kindle device and access to our library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid holidays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;We come from all around the world, from many different cultures, speak dozens of languages, and make beautiful products. We invite you to become part of a special team!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>AR Workflow: Customer Success/Onboarding Specialist (SaaS)</title>
      <region>Latin America Only</region>
      <category>Customer Support</category>
      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0081/9012/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&amp;w=50&amp;h=50&amp;dpr=2&amp;fit=fill&amp;auto=compress" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Remote
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.arworkflow.com/"&gt;https://www.arworkflow.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Are you a tech-savvy professional with a gift for showing others how easy it can be to use things? AR Workflow is looking for someone like you to join our team as a Customer Success/Onboarding Specialist.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;A high-growth start-up offering subscription-as-a-service software to disaster restoration contractors, we're a small, energetic company. You'll have a chance to make a big impact here. It's also a great place to grow. We're passionate about building a diverse workplace that reflects the changing nature of work and provides opportunities for competent people with talent, drive, and enthusiasm to thrive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a Customer Success/Onboarding Specialist, your primary task will be assisting prospective and existing customers by demonstrating and explaining the many advantages of using AR Workflow. The goal is to always deliver a delightful customer experience and maximize customer retention. You'll need to provide both administrative and operational support to the members of our Customer Service team as they work to retain and grow our subscription list. Customer Support Specialist is a fast-moving role that demands exceptional communication and people skills, an eye for detail, the ability to think on your feet, and the willingness to adapt to constant change.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You will be working directly with the founder and original developer. You will be able to influence and make real changes and see the results of those changes immediately. You will learn what it takes to build a software product that makes a huge difference for the businesses we serve, and that people love to use every single day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities and Day-to-Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;As a small company, we sometimes must wear more than one hat. If you’re someone who prefers to stay in your lane and within your comfort zone, this type of role is not one you’re going to enjoy. This role does not require that you know how to code, and there will be no coding involved as part of this role. It does require, however, that you are technically minded enough that you can explain more complex functionality in the software in a compelling and easy-to-understand way to a prospect that does not have as much technical inclination.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;There are four main categories that will make up your day-to-day:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demo and Onboarding meetings with prospects/new users over Zoom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ongoing relationship management and customer success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Let’s dive into each one of these a little bit further:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Demo and Onboarding meetings with prospects/new users over Zoom&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Your first responsibility will be to help grow the company by converting inbound leads into paying customers. You will engage with prospects who have signed up for a free trial or requested a product demo and show them how to be successful with the software, so they continue as paid subscribers. At first, you will be connecting with the prospect to discover their pain points. You will be explaining and demonstrating how our solution can solve those pain points, and then going right into the onboarding and implementation from there. The sale is made after we prove we can walk the walk, and they see their workflows playing out in the software.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ongoing relationship management and customer success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Once the prospect becomes a paid subscriber, you will continue to build relationships with the customer. You will be strategically reaching out to certain customers to increase engagement and reduce the risk of them churning out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;As you will be spending a significant portion of your time speaking with existing and prospective customers, you will be learning all about the problems they are facing and what is important to them. With this information in hand, we will work together on the product roadmap to prioritize new features and capabilities to be built into the system based on the direct feedback you are receiving. Despite our small team size, we build lightning fast with new features and updates rolling out constantly, so it will be fun to watch the evolution of the app and to delight customers with the kind of speed that makes them feel like this was built just for them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Customer support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Another large part of the role while not in meetings or conversations with customers is providing support. You will answer questions and respond to issues reported by customers over email and live chat. You will also provide phone and Zoom-based support.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Side projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You may be thinking by now that everything above sounds like a lot and how will you have time for side projects? We’re building out the team to spread out the meetings and support so that you also have time to contribute to valuable and impactful side projects. All these projects will share a common goal – making the other parts of your job easier and allowing you to be even more successful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For example, based on your skills and interest, you might:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design new onboarding workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new user guides and documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance or create drip email campaigns and email copy to improve user engagement and conversion&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Spending company money should be more fun than it actually is.  If you'd like to turn the fun back on for our customers, read on.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our company is different and our customer support team is different. We communicate openly and we work well together so we are a tight-knit team. We see everyone in the company each morning for check-in and once a week for Show and Tell where we chat, show our work, and play a fun game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Knack: Customer Support Specialist</title>
      <region>USA Only</region>
      <category>Customer Support</category>
      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; US
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://knack.com"&gt;https://knack.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Hi, thanks for reading about our &lt;strong&gt;Customer Support Specialist &lt;/strong&gt;opportunity! We're glad you're here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We're Knack, a code-free platform used by thousands of customers — from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies — to easily build custom apps, workflows, and databases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our Customer Success team is about much more than just responding to customer issues. As a Customer Support Specialist, you are in the best position to understand how our customers find value, how they use our product, and where they struggle. A big part of this role is to make that knowledge count by helping us figure out how we can make our product and their experience with Knack — amazing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’re looking for an empathetic and patient person that enjoys solving tricky customer problems while looking for ways to improve customer experience in the long-run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Knack is a 100% remote company, with a flat, consensus-driven culture. That means a huge amount of autonomy and ownership to define your work and impact, and the opportunity to have a major impact here is a huge one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We also emphasize the journey over the destination. We're looking for applicants that are opinionated about what matters to them, and want to join a fun, passionate, close-knit team of high-quality human beings that above all enjoy working together. Hopefully, that's you!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In this role, you will:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll guide customers through learning to use Knack and help them to troubleshoot issues through email and our in-app messenger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll improve our product by gathering customer feedback and, over time, recognizing patterns and areas where customers are struggling that we need to address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll advocate for our customers and work with our product team to help them understand what changes should be prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll help improve our knowledge base and other support materials by writing, creating, and updating content, and by making suggestions for new support content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll help improve our internal support team resources, including writing canned responses, adding to our internal knowledge base, and making suggestions for improving processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll be the face of the company. Our customers interact with our Success team more than any other team in our company. When our customers think of Knack, they will think of the experiences they have with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Here are some of the "must haves" to be successful in this role:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re patient, empathetic, and enjoy working with customers. You don’t just want to resolve an issue. You get a kick out of making a customer’s day better and putting them at ease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have at least one year of experience in a customer support role for a web-based, technical product and you provided support through email (chat support would be a bonus). You’ve been in the trenches and understand both the incredible value that customer support provides and the work that it takes to give customers a great experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enjoy solving new problems every day and won't give up if you don't find the answer right away. Our product is very robust and it's not the kind of product that you will learn everything about in a month, year, or 5 years. So if you like challenges and puzzles, keep reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re always on the lookout for ways to make things better for customers and you’re willing to advocate for those changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have excellent written communication skills. You can break down complex topics into easy-to-follow guidance while being friendly and professional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience with writing or creating help content (i.e. articles, videos, etc.) and understand best practices for doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here are a few other hints that you might be the person we’re looking for (you match up with a number of these):&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a sense of humor, a sense of humility, and take your work much more seriously than you take yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experience supporting a highly technical, SaaS product or experience with technical troubleshooting related to APIs, HTML/CSS, or Javascript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are excited about exploring growth and career opportunities &lt;a href="https://coda.io/d/Knack-Applicant-Handbook-Customer-Success_dk_QDO3V5Ft/Hey-there_su2Q-#_luKzE"&gt;within a customer support team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are comfortable advocating for what you need to do your best work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are excited to work in an environment that emphasizes both autonomy and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are totally okay with big swings, wild experiments, and learning through failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;More Info!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You will interact with customers through phone and/or chat/email, helping them with anything they need!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduling &amp;amp; Hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;GBA's providing service on the Omni platform choose their own schedule by self-scheduling in 30-minute or 1-hour blocks. &lt;strong&gt;You get to choose how when &amp;amp; how often you provide services.&lt;/strong&gt; The more hours you work, the more you can make!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a 1099 contractor, &lt;strong&gt;write your own schedule (set your own hours)&lt;/strong&gt;! Take control of your work by leaving the 9 to 5 &amp;amp; join the gig economy!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You may have heard about other gigs, but we're different. How? It’s simple: &lt;strong&gt;We pay for available time!&lt;/strong&gt; No more wasting time hoping you're busy enough to earn a living. Working on the Omni platform, you will ACTUALLY make up to $20/hour*! The more hours you work, the more you earn!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work from home, or any quiet place with a closed door&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing when &amp;amp; how often you want to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond to chats, emails, and calls from customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly help customers with good solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve problems in a creative way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document details of calls &amp;amp; customer interactions in the appropriate systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type and talk at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate multiple systems, programs, and screens at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who You Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great communication skills (verbal and written)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can type 20 WPM or more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid computer skills, including typing and navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable empathizing and remaining patient with difficult callers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Earning Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Projects will have varying earning potential, but all projects pay for time spent talking on the phone &amp;amp; assisting customers (unlike other gig companies - we pay you for available time!) You may also receive performance-based pay &amp;amp; other incentives (earnings depend on hours worked, project, type of support provided, etc).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a self-employed 1099 Independent Contractor providing work-from-home customer support services, you are responsible for your own tax obligations. Actual earnings may vary depending on campaign, call type, call volume, and other factors. Independent Contractors are responsible for expenses and control their own income.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you want the flexibility and freedom to work for your life, instead of living to work, complete these steps &amp;amp; be sure to check your email &amp;amp; phone for regular communications from the Omni platform!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

      <region>Anywhere in the World</region>
      <category>Customer Support</category>
      <type>Full-Time</type>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Headquarters:&lt;/strong&gt; Miami, FL
    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.convertflow.com"&gt;https://www.convertflow.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Independent brands need your help – Here's your chance to join the independent ecommerce movement and impact the future of ecommerce.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;At ConvertFlow, we're helping brands own their growth and stay independent of big tech platforms that seek to control how consumers shop and who they shop with.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For independent ecommerce brands, the big tech platforms are increasingly feeling like "the empire" that's oppressing them with margin-crushing platform fees and ever-increasing ad costs, limiting access to new customers and the brand's existing audience.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We're "arming the rebels" by empowering independent brands with the tools they need to deliver personalized shopping experiences across the channels they own, such as their own website, email &amp;amp; SMS audience. This way, they can win over more customers, increase loyalty, and create a thriving business that controls its future.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;To do this, we've built ConvertFlow, the all-in-one funnel builder for ecommerce – which empowers brands to create, test and personalize shopping experiences, without coding or relying on developers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://float.com"&gt;http://float.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Who We Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Float is the world’s leading software for teams to plan their time and, behind it, is a world-class team looking for a Customer Support Specialist (Americas) in Mountain or Pacific time zones (candidates in South America, Canada or Mexico locations only please) to join us. From New York to the UK, Canada to South Africa&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;our Engineering, Product, Marketing, and Customer Success teams work asynchronously, helping brands such as Airbnb, Buzzfeed, and Ogilvy plan and manage their time better. Float is self-funded, profitable, and growing. If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.float.com/about/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;align with our values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and are looking to join a team that’s passionate about helping others work and live more productively, we want to hear from you. Here are a &lt;a href="https://www.float.com/blog/applying-for-a-remote-job/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;few tips from our CEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make sure your resume stands out from the crowd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Why We’re Hiring For This Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Helping customers succeed requires a great product and support from a team of experts that can help facilitate and realize the product's potential. The quality in which we deliver support is one of our competitive advantages, and accelerates our opportunity to be successful as a category-leading service. At a fundamental level, it’s core to our service level offering that we provide customer support during typical business hours worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With our primary customer regions being EMEA and Americas, we look to have a full Support team that is able to tackle our inbound support requests and also identify opportunities to be proactive and improve the overall customer experience. Our team, although small, covers the full customer journey - from first learning how to use Float, setting up billing and invoices, troubleshooting bugs and issues, sharing feedback and feature requests, and assisting with account changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our Director of Customer Success, Alison, explains the important role you will play within our Customer Success team. &lt;a href="https://www.loom.com/share/14d4b71702544d888fe4d5fca7239b58"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch this video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You’ll be working asynchronously with a bright, dedicated team from across the globe, with a strong focus on finding solutions for our customer community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Be Responsible For&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our support department is our front-line team who works hands-on with our customers to answer questions, provide troubleshooting for bugs and issues, and manage our inbound sales leads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the first few months your main priority will be:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the ins and outs of Float to become a product expert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a shift of inbound tickets through Intercom and help address questions, feature requests, or bugs. The best way to learn is to jump right in!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the troubleshooting process for customer issues and bugs and identify escalations for Tier 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to enhancing our existing support collateral (internal training library, FAQ content, macros) to improve the quality and efficiency of our responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share feature requests from users in Canny and additional feedback to our Product team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;As you’ve become more comfortable in the role you’ll:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using reporting to identify opportunities to improve efficiency in how we address tickets or escalate issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other teams like Sales, Account Management, Marketing, and Product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify projects that directly impact our OKRs and plan how to implement them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new resources to improve the self-service model of support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the opportunity to have a real impact on our growing team!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What You’ll Need To Be Successful&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We want you to love your work and believe that these skills will allow you to succeed in the role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Applying these skills requires:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience successfully working in a SaaS-based Customer Support team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vibrant, clear, communication skills - delivers messages clearly and efficiently, and can speak to different skill or knowledge levels&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Natural problem solver with a moderate understanding of technical concepts like APIs and finding errors in the Dev Tools in a browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable using video, screenshots, or email to solve customer issues effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a fully remote team, we’re looking for someone comfortable with asynchronous communication as the default, which means you have previous remote experience and are comfortable using tools like Slack, Loom, and Asana to communicate as needed. Don’t worry—you will have significant deep work time since we have &lt;a href="https://www.float.com/blog/how-to-create-a-culture-with-fewer-meetings/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very few meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.float.com/about/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn more about our team, mission and values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;The salary for this role is US $94,947 (Level 3). Here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.float.com/blog/why-were-changing-the-way-we-compensate-at-float/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blog post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with more information on how we determine our salaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Note: Industry research shows that women and those in traditionally underrepresented groups generally don’t apply to jobs unless they check all the boxes for the role. If you feel strongly that you have what it takes for this role but don’t check 100% of the boxes—that’s okay—we encourage you to apply anyway and highlight what you can bring to the table.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hiring Process For This Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You’ll find a lot of useful information about our interview process and what it’s like to join our global team on the &lt;a href="https://www.float.com/careers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Float careers page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The hiring process for this role looks like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Initial First Meeting&lt;/em&gt;: If your application is shortlisted, you will have a 15-minute meeting with our Talent team. This meeting gives us an opportunity to learn more about your experience and also allows you to ask any questions you have about the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Manager Interview&lt;/em&gt;: You’ll meet with Alison, our Director of Customer Success, for a more technical interview. This is generally a 45-minute interview that will take a deep dive into your customer support skills and experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Founder Interview:&lt;/em&gt; As the final step in the interview process, you’ll meet with Glenn, Float’s CEO, for a 30-minute interview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Reference Chats:&lt;/em&gt; We ask for a prior manager reference and we also connect you with a Float team member so can ask those important questions to help you make the best decision as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our hiring process takes an average of 29 days from the first interview to a job offer (based on 2022 data). The Talent team will be in touch each step of the way to ensure that you are well informed and aware of the next step in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unfortunately, due to the high volume of applications, we only contact candidates who have been shortlisted for the role. If you do not hear from us within 14 business days of submitting your application, we encourage you to apply for another role in the future.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Deskpro is award winning helpdesk software that helps to bring better online customer service to millions of people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our helpdesk software platform allows organizations to consolidate all of their customer support channels (email, phone, live chat, social) into one place. Giving them the software tools needed to provide incredible customer support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our Technical Support Engineers help diagnose and solve technical issues by email, phone, and chat. They work with big enterprise customers who have sysadmins of their own, all the way down to single-user accounts with not-so-technical administrators. We aim to provide fast and accurate help whenever it's needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: Please only apply for this role if you are physically located in Australia and willing to work AEST, as the hours for the role are based around Sydney time zone (AEST) 10am - 7pm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will you be doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a varied customer-facing role. You'll be performing deep technical troubleshooting to help solve complex problems for our customers, such as helping customers install the software, manage testing of VM's and proposing improvements to the software as well as finding workarounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, working closely with our Customer Support team and other Technical Support engineers, you'll often work directly with our software engineers (e.g. reproducing issues, collecting technical information/diagnostics etc) to identify issues in our products and coordinate solutions with customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Requirements&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3+ years experience in technical support (L3), preferably in product support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Located in Australia (UTC +9 to UTC +11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong written and verbal communication skills are required. You will interact with customers in different stages from pre-sales to potential crisis scenarios. Empathy for our customers and determination to fight in their corner is critical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to learn how to support Deskpro’s technical elements (e.g installing software on servers, APIs, integrations, installers, data migration etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A love for problem solving, troubleshooting issues and a strong drive to learn new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core competencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Strong familiarity with multiple Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and RHEL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience supporting Nginx, PHP and MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience identifying and diagnosing issues from analysing logs, stack traces, browser development tools and HAR exports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creative problem solving. Deskpro runs on-premise as well as in the cloud; sometimes you will be troubleshooting with incomplete information with no direct access to customer services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experience with Windows and Windows Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A 'home office' budget, computer, screens and desk set-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal budget for training and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
